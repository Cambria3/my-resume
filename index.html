    <p style="text-align:center">I'm a web budding web developer and programmer that's currently learning how to create <br>
        websites and programs in Python. I also have an interest in cybersecurity and have <br>
        recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera.
        <br><br>

        I enjoy learning how to code, and have just finished creating a short interactive <br>
        text based story in Python using Tkinter and Pygame. As soon as I've figured out <br>
        how to add that to my portfolio, I'll add it, along with <br>
        any other projects I complete. <br><br>
